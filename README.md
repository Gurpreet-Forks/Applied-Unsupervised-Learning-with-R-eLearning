# Applied Unsupervised Learning with R eLearning
Starting with the basics, Applied Unsupervised Learning with R explains clustering 
methods, distribution analysis, data encoders, and all the features of R that enable 
you to understand your data better and get answers to all your business questions.

## What you will learn
*  Implement clustering methods such as k-means, agglomerative, and divisive 
clustering
* Write code in R to analyze market segmentation and consumer behavior
* Estimate distributions and probabilities of different outcomes
* Implement dimension reduction using principal component analysis
* Apply anomaly detection methods to identify fraud
* Design algorithms with R and learn how to edit or improve code

### Hardware Requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Storage**: 5 GB available space
* An Internet connection

### Software Requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* **OS**: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit, Linux 
(Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, or Suse), or the latest version of OS X
* R (3.0.0 or more recent, available for free at https://cran.r-project.org/)
